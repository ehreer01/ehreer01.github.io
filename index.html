<p> I'm Erik E and I'm what you might call a paintball  enthusiast. I've been intrested in paintball since I was a freshman in high school. I loved the rush I felt when ran into the frey during my first game. I hid behind a bunker as balls of paint broke around me. I felt a quick sting on my shoulder and I looked down as paint ran down the sleeve of my shirt. My greatest fear of playing paintball was all of the pain invoved. Once that ball broke on my sleeve all of my fear left me as a windy day clears the sky of clouds. From that day on I was hooked and I would continute to take part in all that the sport had to offer. </p>
