<h1> The Birth of a (Paint)Baller </h1> 


<p> I'm Erik E and I'm what you might call a paintball enthusiast. I've been intrested in paintball since I was a freshman in high school. I loved the rush I felt when ran into the frey during my first game. I hid behind a bunker as balls of paint broke around me. I felt a quick sting on my shoulder and I looked down as paint ran down the sleeve of my shirt. My greatest fear of playing paintball was all of the pain invoved. Once that ball broke on my sleeve all of my fear left me as a windy day clears the sky of clouds. From that day on I was hooked and I would continute to take part in all that the sport had to offer. </p>

<p> The sport of Paintball works something like this: Commonly there are two teams of players that face off against one anouther. Eeach player is armed with a paintball gun or a "marker." The two teams are given an objective they work to accomplish. Some common objectives are: Capture the Flag, Eliminate all the other teams players or protect the presisdent. In paintball the games one can play are nearly limitless. Players are "out of the game" is a circle of paint the size of quarter apears anywhere on their body or equipment.     </p>

  <p> There are two kinds of paintball games tha are commonly played. The most popular kind of paintball is played in the woods and is aptly named "woodsball.: Anouther kind of paintball played is "Speedball." Speedball is played professionaly by paintball teams all around the US. It is played behind inflateable bunkers and usally moves at a faster pace than woodsball. </p>

<p> All painball players must use proper masks in order to keep thier eyes safe! When played properly painball is acutally safer than the sport of Bowling! </p>

  <p> In the end I think that paintball is really fun sport that has many benfits such as teamwork, overcoming fear and exercise! I think that everyone should try it at least once! </p>
